TG-019 — Frontend: /assistant minimal chat UI + citations

Goal
Provide a simple assistant screen that talks to POST /api/assist, shows grounded answers with citations, and handles rate limits/errors gracefully.

Scope
- Route: /assistant (use existing sidebar slot).
- UI:
  • Message list (user/assistant bubbles).
  • Input box + Send; Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline.
  • Loading/thinking state while awaiting reply.
  • Citations list per assistant message: show basename(sourcePath) and stage (if present).
- API:
  • POST /api/assist with { message, cropId, variety, topK: 6, temperature: 0.2 }.
  • If current greenhouse exists, you may omit cropId/variety (server uses it).
- State:
  • Keep last 20 messages in memory; persist transcript to localStorage keyed by userId + cropId/variety.
  • Clear transcript when crop/variety changes.
- Errors:
  • 429 → show toast “Rate limit — try later”.
  • Network/error → inline retry button on the failed bubble.
  • No chunks → friendly notice “I don’t have docs for this crop yet.”
- Dev:
  • If response contains `retrieval` (RAG_DEBUG=true), add a small “Show retrieval” toggle under each assistant message to expand the matched chunks (dev-only).

Acceptance
- Sending a message renders an assistant reply with at least 1 citation when RAG has chunks for the current crop.
- Switching the greenhouse crop clears the transcript.
- UI uses Flowbite React; no horizontal scroll on mobile; full-height layout respected.
- Graceful handling of 429 and network failures.

Out of scope
- Streaming responses, tool-calling, or multi-turn function execution.
- Styling beyond basic Flowbite components + project palette.
- Backend changes.

Notes
- Keep diffs focused to src/features/assistant/* plus small additions in shared UI if needed.
- Never include secrets in client code.
