# TG-001 — Public Login/Signup Route (UI only)

**Goal**  
Provide a single public `/login` route showing a Flowbite **Card** that can **flip** between Sign In and Sign Up forms. No real auth. Sign In button just redirects to `/`.

---

## Scope
- Create **one** public route: `/login`.
- Build **UI only** for Sign In / Sign Up inside a **single flipping card** (no backend calls).
- Add basic **route protection**: `/login` is public; everything else is protected (redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`). Stub auth is fine.
- On **Sign In** click: navigate to `/` unconditionally (temporary behavior).
- Forms: **email** and **password** fields for both views. No validation beyond basic HTML/types.

## Out of Scope
- Real authentication, social login, form validation library, backend, API keys, cookies/localStorage for tokens.
- Any database or user model.

## Files to Create/Modify (suggested)
- `src/app/routes.tsx` — add `/login`; protect other routes (simple guard/HOC).
- `src/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx` — main screen with the flipping Flowbite Card.
- `src/features/auth/components/AuthCard.tsx` — the flipping card (sign-in/sign-up faces).
- `src/shared/ui/Flip.tsx` — small utility component or CSS helper for flip animation (optional).
- `src/styles/index.css` — add minimal flip CSS (if not done in component).

## UI/UX Requirements
- Use **Flowbite React** components (Card, Button, TextInput, Label). Keep Tailwind classes minimal and readable.
- The card must **flip** (CSS transform or class toggle) when the user switches between **Sign In** and **Sign Up**.
- Provide clear toggles/links: “Have an account? Sign in” / “New here? Sign up”.
- Mobile-friendly layout; centered column on small screens.

## Routing & Guard (temporary)
- Public: `/login` (always accessible).
- Protected: all other routes. If “not authenticated”, redirect to `/login`.
- Stub auth: keep a simple `useAuth()` hook returning `{ isAuthenticated: false }`. On successful "Sign In" click, **temporarily navigate to `/`** (no state persistence).

## Steps (Execution Plan)
1. Add `/login` to `routes.tsx` and a simple guard for other routes.
2. Create `LoginPage.tsx` and render `AuthCard` centered in the viewport.
3. Implement `AuthCard` with two faces and a flip state:
   - **Sign In**: email, password, “Sign in” button → `navigate('/')`.
   - **Sign Up**: email, password, “Create account” button → no-op for now.
   - Toggle link switches faces and flips the card.
4. Add minimal flip CSS (rotateY / preserve-3d) in a co-located CSS module or `styles/index.css`.
5. Smoke checks (see below).

## Smoke Checks (must pass)
- `npm run dev` starts with no red console errors.
- `/login` loads; card flips between Sign In/Sign Up.
- Clicking “Sign in” navigates to `/`.
- Navigating directly to a protected route redirects to `/login`.
- Layout is usable on mobile width (no horizontal scroll).

## Notes for Agents
- Keep diffs focused; do not reformat unrelated files.
- Prefer Flowbite components and Tailwind classes; no extra UI libs.
- Name components/files as suggested; co-locate small helpers with the feature.
