# Soil Mix Basics — Indoor Containers

**Goals.** Provide roots with air, water, nutrients, and mechanical support while minimizing disease and overwatering risk.

## Core recipes (by volume)
- **General purpose, free‑draining (good for peppers/leafy greens):**  
  **70% universal potting soil + 30% perlite.** Optional: 5% vermiculite for a touch more water retention.
- **Coco‑forward mix (lights, faster dry‑down):**  
  **50% coco coir + 30% perlite + 20% composted material.**
- **Seed‑starting (lighter and finer):**  
  **60% sifted potting soil + 30% perlite + 10% vermiculite.** Avoid strong fertilizers at sowing.

**Perlite vs. vermiculite.** Perlite = drainage and aeration. Vermiculite = water retention. Balance them to match your environment: cooler, dim rooms usually need **more aeration** rather than more water‑holding.

**pH & EC.** For peppers and many edibles in soilless mixes, aim **pH 6.0–6.8**. EC guidance is rough in soil; observe plants first. In hydro/coco, typical EC bands are lower for seedlings and moderate later.

## Watering heuristics
- **Squeeze test:** pre‑moisten mix to *field capacity*—it should clump when squeezed and barely weep water.
- Water when the **top 1–2 cm** dry; lift the pot—weight is a reliable signal.
- Ensure **drainage holes**; empty saucers after watering.

## Hygiene & reuse
- Use clean pots and tools; consider pasteurizing reused media (low‑temp oven or hot water) if you had pest issues.
- To deter **fungus gnats**, let the top layer dry and consider a thin **sand/perlite cap**; sticky traps help monitoring.

## Container guidance
- For compact peppers like *Prairie Fire*: **1.5–3.0 L** works well.
- Avoid over‑potting seedlings; step up gradually as roots fill the container.

## Light & environment coupling
Strong light and warm temps increase transpiration → mixes can be a bit more water‑holding.  
Cool rooms and weak light reduce transpiration → prefer **more perlite**, shallower but more frequent watering.

## First‑run calibration checklist
- Pre‑moisten new mix to field capacity.
- Fill the pot, let drain, **weigh the pot** → note “wet weight”.
- After a normal dry‑down, weigh again → note “dry weight”.
- Your watering trigger is somewhere between these weights; combine with finger test on the top layer.

**Notes for RAG.** This article provides general substrate heuristics referenced by crop files. Configuration defaults must come from each crop’s YAML; these notes justify choices and help explain trade‑offs.
