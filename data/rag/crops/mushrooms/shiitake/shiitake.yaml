  displayName: "Shiitake (Lentinula edodes)"
  version: 1
  defaultStage: spawn-run

overview: |
  Revered gourmet mushroom with rich umami flavor and beautiful chestnut caps.
  Suited to small indoor rigs using supplemented hardwood blocks; rewards patience
  with dense, photogenic clusters when hydration, humidity, and fresh air are right.

growth_timing:
  colonization_days: "20–45 at 20–24°C (strain/substrate dependent)"
  browning_maturation_days: "10–30 after full colonization (block surface turns brown)"
  days_to_pinning: "3–10 after cold-water soak and fresh-air/light trigger"
  harvest_window: "4–7 days from first pins to first flush harvest"
  flushes: "Typically 2–4 flushes; re-soak between flushes"
  notes: "Cool-fruiting strains prefer 12–18°C; warm strains can fruit up to ~24°C with lower quality risk."

stages:
  - id: spawn-run
    label: "Spawn run (colonization)"
    cues:
      - "Block turns fully white and firm; no uncolonized patches"
    guidance: |
      Keep warm (20–24°C), clean, and mostly sealed. Do not disturb or open the bag early;
      the long colonization increases contamination risk if handled.

  - id: browning
    label: "Browning / Maturation"
    cues:
      - "Surface dries and turns brown; small cracks/veins may appear"
    guidance: |
      Allow 10–30 days for proper browning after full colonization. Browning improves yields
      and reduces bacterial issues. Do not initiate fruiting before this stage.

  - id: primordia
    label: "Primordia / Pinning"
    cues:
      - "After cold-water soak (12–24 h) and exposure to fresh air + diffuse light, tiny pins form"
    guidance: |
      Maintain high humidity (~90%) and good fresh-air exchange. Avoid direct, hot airflow that dries the surface.

  - id: fruiting
    label: "Fruiting"
    cues:
      - "Caps expand; edges round out; stems remain modest under good FAE"
    guidance: |
      Target 12–18°C (cool-fruiting strains) with 85–95% RH and steady fresh air. Keep the block moist but avoid pooling.
      Harvest when caps are mostly flat with slight in-roll; do not wait for heavy spore drop.

  - id: rest
    label: "Rest / Next flush prep"
    cues:
      - "After harvest, block rests and rehydrates before the next flush"
    guidance: |
      Rest 7–14 days at moderate humidity; then re-soak the block (cold water) to initiate another flush.

warnings:
  - stage: spawn-run
    text: "Early opening increases contamination risk; wait for full colonization."
  - stage: browning
    text: "Immature (unbrowned) blocks fruit poorly and contaminate more easily—allow proper maturation."
  - stage: primordia
    text: "Insufficient humidity or an incomplete soak leads to aborted pins; ensure ~90% RH and adequate hydration."
  - stage: fruiting
    text: "Heavy spore production—ventilate and filter; avoid breathing concentrated spores."
  - stage: any
    text: "Avoid settings outside safety bounds; change gradually and monitor response."

faq:
  - q: "Do shiitake require a cold-water soak?"
    a: "Yes—most blocks need a 12–24 h cold soak to trigger a flush, followed by high humidity and fresh air."

  - q: "What temperature should I fruit at?"
    a: "Cool strains: 12–18°C. Warm strains can fruit nearer 18–22°C, but quality may decline at higher temps."

  - q: "Do they need much light?"
    a: "Diffuse, low-intensity light (6–12 h/day) is enough for orientation and cap quality—avoid heat from lamps."

  - q: "How do I know the block is ready to fruit?"
    a: "After full colonization, wait for the **browning** stage (10–30 d). Then soak and introduce FAE + humidity."

  - q: "How many flushes can I expect?"
    a: "Typically 2–4 flushes with a rest and re-soak between each. Yields depend on strain, substrate, and hydration."

  - q: "My caps crack or dry out—what’s wrong?"
    a: "RH is too low or airflow too hot/drying. Raise humidity, soften airflow, and avoid direct heat."

  - q: "Stems long and caps small?"
    a: "CO₂ too high—boost fresh-air exchange and avoid stagnant rooms."

  - q: "Is contamination common?"
    a: "Long colonization increases risk. Keep tools and surfaces clean; discard green molds; start over if blocks sour."
