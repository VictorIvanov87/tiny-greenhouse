# Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) — Cultivation Notes

**Character.** Dense, savory caps with classic umami. Compared with oysters, shiitake is slower and a touch more
particular, but highly rewarding once you respect its staging: **colonize → brown → soak → fruit → rest → repeat**.

## Staging & environment
- **Spawn run:** 20–24°C, clean handling, minimal disturbance. Wait for a **fully white, firm** block.
- **Browning:** Allow **10–30 days** post-colonization for the surface to turn brown—this maturation step improves yield and quality.
- **Pinning trigger:** **Cold-water soak (12–24 h)** then introduce **fresh air**, **high humidity (~90%)**, and **diffuse light (6–12 h/day)**.
- **Fruiting:** Prefer **cool** conditions—**12–18°C** with **85–95% RH** and steady FAE. Keep the block moist/glossy; avoid pooling.
- **Next flush:** Rest **7–14 days**, then **re-soak** to initiate the following flush.

## Substrates & containers
- Best on **sterilized hardwood sawdust** supplemented with bran/soy hulls (oak/beech favored). Let the block **brown inside the bag**;
  then remove the bag to fruit from the exposed block. Typical bag size **3–5 L**.

## Air, humidity, light
- Shiitake needs **fresh air**—stagnant rooms lead to **long stems/small caps**. Keep humidity high during fruiting (85–95% RH)
  but avoid direct, drying airflow. Light is low-intensity and diffuse; avoid heating the block with lamps.

## Harvest & handling
- Harvest when caps are **mostly flat** with slight in-roll; avoid heavy spore drop. Twist or cut clusters cleanly and handle gently.
  Expect **2–4 flushes** with a re-soak between them.

## Troubleshooting
- **Aborted pins:** insufficient humidity or soak; re-check hydration and RH.
- **Cracked/dry caps:** humidity too low or airflow too harsh—raise RH, soften airflow.
- **Green mold (Trichoderma):** isolate and discard contaminated blocks; review cleanliness.
- **Slow/weak fruiting:** block was not fully browned or room is too warm; allow full maturation and cool the fruiting area.

**Safety bounds.** Keep recommendations within **8–26°C**, **0–16 h light**, and **85–95% RH** during fruiting; treat
excursions as warnings with rationale.

**For RAG.** Use the crop YAML for configuration defaults and bounds; rely on these notes for *why/heuristics* and user coaching.
