# Oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus) — Cultivation Notes

**Why oysters.** Vigorous, adaptable gourmet mushrooms that reward small indoor setups with dramatic clusters and
short cycles. Excellent for learning: clear visual cues, forgiving of minor mistakes, and widely available spawn.

## Environment & staging
- **Spawn run (colonization):** 20–24°C, limited fresh air, dark/low light; bags remain closed to retain CO₂ and moisture.
  Open early = contamination risk. Wait until the block is fully white and firm.
- **Pinning trigger:** Once colonized, introduce **fresh air**, **high humidity (~90%)**, and **diffuse light (8–12 h/day)**.
- **Fruiting:** 18–22°C, **85–95% RH**, and **low CO₂** (short stems, wide caps). Keep surfaces glistening without pooling.
- **Second flush:** Rest the block 5–10 days and rehydrate as needed.

## Substrates
- **Pasteurized straw** (approachable, rapid colonization) or **sterilized hardwood sawdust** with supplements (higher yields).
- Keep prep and inoculation clean: sanitize tools, wipe surfaces, flame/70% alcohol where appropriate.

## Air & humidity
- Oysters demand **high fresh-air exchange (FAE)** during fruiting; excess CO₂ causes long stems and small caps.
- Use **gentle fans** and mist/fog frequently. If caps crack or pins abort, humidity is likely too low.

## Light
- They do not need high-intensity light—**diffuse light** is enough for orientation and cap formation.
  Avoid hot spots and leaf-level lamp distances used for plants.

## Harvest & handling
- Harvest when caps are **mostly flat** with slight in-roll. Twist or cut clusters cleanly.
- Keep the block intact; bruising reduces later flushes.

## Troubleshooting
- **Long stems, tiny caps:** Increase FAE; reduce CO₂; avoid heat buildup.
- **Dry edges / cracking:** Raise humidity; mist more often; reduce fan intensity if it desiccates surfaces.
- **Green patches (Trichoderma):** Isolate and discard contaminated blocks; review cleanliness.

**Safety bounds & policy.** Keep recommendations within **10–28°C** and **0–16 h light** with **85–95% RH** in fruiting.
Treat excursions as warnings with clear rationale.

**For RAG.** Use the crop YAML for configuration defaults and bounds. These notes provide the *why* and practical heuristics.
