  displayName: "Prairie Fire"
  version: 1
  defaultStage: germination

overview: |
  Compact ornamental chilli that loads up with jewel-like pods ripening from cream to yellow to orange to red.
  Bred for containers and tight spaces, it stays neat and productive, delivering continuous flushes with minimal fuss.
  Perfect for windowsills and mini-greenhouses where you want color, heat, and quick wins.

growth_timing:
  germination_days: "7–14 (faster at 24–30°C)"
  days_to_first_true_leaves: "7–10 after sprout"
  days_to_first_flower: "55–80 from sowing (slower in cool rooms)"
  days_to_maturity: "85–110 from sowing, depending on light/temp"
  notes: "Times are indicative; cooler temps or low DLI (daily light) will delay milestones."

stages:
  - id: germination
    label: "Germination"
    cues:
      - "Seeds sown 5–8 mm deep in a light, well-drained mix"
      - "Medium warm (24–30°C), evenly moist (not soggy)"
    guidance: |
      Use a heat mat if room temp is ≤22°C. Vent gently once/day to prevent damping-off.
      Provide low-intensity light as soon as seeds crack to prevent legginess.

  - id: seedling
    label: "Seedling"
    cues:
      - "First true leaves present; stems starting to firm"
      - "Internode length short under adequate light"
    guidance: |
      14–16 h light; gentle airflow; avoid cold drafts <18°C at night. Water when the
      top 1–2 cm of mix is dry. Begin very light feeding once/week after true leaves.

  - id: vegetative
    label: "Vegetative"
    cues:
      - "4–6 leaf sets; branching begins; root mass expands"
    guidance: |
      12–14 h light. Keep moisture even; do not overpot too early—step up gradually.
      Support compact growth by keeping light close (without heat stress) and light pinching if needed.

  - id: flowering
    label: "Flowering/Fruiting"
    cues:
      - "Buds visible; first open flowers; fruit set follows"
    guidance: |
      Aim ~12 h light with consistent day temperatures; avoid overwatering—slight dry-back improves set.
      A slightly leaner feed helps fruiting; support branches if fruit load becomes heavy.

warnings:
  - stage: germination
    text: "Room-temp (~21–22°C) germination is possible but slower; a heat mat speeds sprout and evens emergence."
  - stage: seedling
    text: "Insufficient light leads to stretch/legginess; keep light close and increase photoperiod to 16 h."
  - stage: flowering
    text: "Chronic overwatering or sudden temp drops can cause blossom drop; allow slight dry-back."
  - stage: any
    text: "Do not exceed safety bounds; clamp configuration to safe min/max and adjust gradually."

faq:
  - q: "Can I start Prairie Fire at room temperature (~21–22°C)?"
    a: "Yes, but expect slower germination and later first flowers. A heat mat (24–30°C medium) accelerates the early phase."

  - q: "How much light do seedlings need?"
    a: "Aim for 14–16 h/day with the light source close enough to prevent stretch. Keep leaf temps comfortable (avoid scorching)."

  - q: "What soil mix works best in small containers?"
    a: "Use a free-draining mix: roughly 70% universal potting soil + 30% perlite. Avoid heavy, waterlogged media."

  - q: "My room is cool. Will fruiting still happen?"
    a: "Yes, but fruit set and ripening slow below ~22°C. Keep days in the 22–28°C range and avoid big night drops."

  - q: "How often should I water?"
    a: "Water when the top 1–2 cm are dry. Overwatering causes root issues and blossom drop, especially during flowering."

  - q: "Do I need to prune or pinch?"
    a: "Light pinching during vegetative can keep plants compact. Avoid heavy pruning right before flowering to prevent delays."

  - q: "When should I up-pot?"
    a: "Step up gradually as roots fill the pot. Overpotting too early keeps media wet and can slow growth."

  - q: "What about fertilizer?"
    a: "Start mild once/week after true leaves (EC≈1.0–1.2), keep moderate in vegetative, and slightly leaner at flowering to encourage fruit set."

  - q: "Can I grow it on a windowsill?"
    a: "Yes, south/south-west exposure helps. If light is weak, extend photoperiod or add supplemental LED to maintain compact growth."

  - q: "Is high humidity a problem?"
    a: "Sustained >70–75% can encourage disease indoors; maintain airflow and avoid leaf-wetting late in the day."
