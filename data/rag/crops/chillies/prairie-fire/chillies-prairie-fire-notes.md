# Prairie Fire — Cultivation Notes (Indoor Mini‑Greenhouse)

**Habit & size.** *Capsicum annuum* cultivar bred for compact ornamental growth. Typical indoor height **20–35 cm** with dense branching and numerous small fruits. Suited to 1.5–3.0 L pots; tighter spacing (**20–25 cm**) is acceptable.

**Temperature.** Grows at common room temps (**21–22°C**) but **germination, flowering, and ripening slow** below ~22°C. Best day range **22–28°C**; nights **18–22°C**. Large night drops (>6–8°C) can cause blossom drop.

**Light.** Prefers strong, steady light. For seedlings target **14–16 h/day**; vegetative **12–14 h**; flowering **~12 h**. Keep the LED close enough to avoid stretch (inspect internode length); ensure leaf temperature stays comfortable (no scorching). If using a PPFD meter, ~**250–400 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹** works well for compact container growth; less is possible with longer photoperiods.

**Humidity & airflow.** Aim **45–60% RH**. Gentle airflow reduces damping‑off and strengthens stems. Avoid persistent >70–75% RH indoors (disease pressure).

**Watering.** Let the **top 1–2 cm** of mix dry between waterings. Avoid constant saturation—roots need oxygen. In cool rooms, reduce frequency; overwatering + low temp = slow growth and drop.

**Nutrition.** In soil/coco mixes: start mild feeding after first true leaves. Typical EC bands: **seedling 1.0–1.2**, **vegetative 1.2–1.6**, **flowering slightly leaner** to encourage fruit set. Target **pH 6.0–6.8**. In soil, EC is only a rough guide; watch the plant.

**Container & training.** Use free‑draining media (see *Soil Mix Basics*). Step‑up pot size gradually to avoid a cold, wet reservoir. Light pinch during vegetative can keep plants compact; avoid heavy pruning right before flowering.

**Pollination.** Self‑fertile flowers; gentle vibration or airflow helps set in still rooms.

**Timeline examples.**
- **Cool room (~21–22°C, no heat mat):** sprout **10–14 d**, first true leaves **+7–10 d**, first flowers **60–90 d**, ripe fruit later depending on light.
- **Warm media (24–30°C) + strong light:** sprout **7–10 d**, first flowers **55–75 d**, earlier ripening.

**Common issues & quick fixes.**
- **Leggy seedlings:** increase photoperiod to 16 h, reduce lamp distance, add airflow.
- **Blossom drop:** avoid sudden cold, prevent overwatering; modest dry‑back helps; don’t over‑nitrogen.
- **Edema / water blisters:** indicates overwatering + low transpiration; let surface dry more, add airflow.
- **Aphids / fungus gnats:** yellow sticky traps; for gnats, let top layer dry and consider a thin sand/perlite cap.

**Harvest.** Fruits color through cream/yellow/orange/red; harvest regularly to encourage continuous set. Wash hands/tools after handling ripe pods.

**Safety bounds (policy reminders).** Keep recommendations within **10–38°C** and **6–20 h light**; present deviations as **warnings** with rationale.

**Notes for RAG.** These notes complement the structured YAML. Prefer YAML defaults for direct configuration; use this document to explain *why* and to give practical heuristics.
