  displayName: "Basket of Fire"
  version: 1
  defaultStage: germination

overview: |
  Trailing, cascading chilli that turns baskets and window boxes into living fireworks.
  Hundreds of bite-size pods ripen in waves for a long, showy season—great for both ornamental pop and fresh kitchen heat.
  Naturally compact and easy to manage, it shines in small indoor rigs and balcony planters.

growth_timing:
  germination_days: "7–14 (faster at 24–30°C)"
  days_to_first_true_leaves: "7–10 after sprout"
  days_to_first_flower: "55–85 from sowing (slower in cool rooms)"
  days_to_maturity: "90–115 from sowing, depending on light/temp"
  notes: "Indicative windows; cooler temps or low DLI delay all milestones."

stages:
  - id: germination
    label: "Germination"
    cues:
      - "Seeds sown 5–8 mm deep in a light, well-drained mix"
      - "Medium warmed to 24–30°C; evenly moist, not waterlogged"
    guidance: |
      Use a heat mat if room temp is ≤22°C. Provide low-intensity light once seeds crack to prevent legginess.

  - id: seedling
    label: "Seedling"
    cues:
      - "First true leaves present; short internodes under adequate light"
    guidance: |
      14–16 h light with the lamp close (no leaf scorching). Gentle airflow. Water when the top 1–2 cm
      are dry. Start very light weekly feeding after true leaves appear.

  - id: vegetative
    label: "Vegetative"
    cues:
      - "4–6 leaf sets; branching and a naturally compact, cascading habit"
    guidance: |
      12–14 h light; even moisture. Avoid overpotting too early—step up gradually. Light pinch can
      encourage bushiness, but avoid heavy pruning right before flowering.

  - id: flowering
    label: "Flowering/Fruiting"
    cues:
      - "Buds visible; first open flowers; heavy fruit set possible"
    guidance: |
      Aim ~12 h light with consistent day temperatures. Avoid chronic overwatering—slight dry-back
      improves fruit set. Harvest regularly to maintain continuous production.

warnings:
  - stage: germination
    text: "Room-temp (~21–22°C) germination is slower; a heat mat speeds and evens emergence."
  - stage: seedling
    text: "Insufficient light causes stretch; keep photoperiod up to 16 h and reduce lamp distance."
  - stage: flowering
    text: "Overwatering and sudden cold lead to blossom drop; allow slight dry-back, keep days steady."
  - stage: any
    text: "Never recommend beyond safety bounds; clamp to safe min/max and change gradually."

faq:
  - q: "Can Basket of Fire start at room temperature (~21–22°C)?"
    a: "Yes, but expect slower sprout and later ripening. Warmer media (24–30°C) accelerates early stages."

  - q: "How much light is needed indoors?"
    a: "Seedlings 14–16 h/day; vegetative 12–14 h; flowering ~12 h. Keep LEDs close enough to prevent
        stretch while avoiding scorching. Longer photoperiods can compensate for lower intensity."

  - q: "What pot size and spacing work for a cascading habit?"
    a: "1.0–2.5 L per plant and 18–22 cm spacing are sufficient for compact growth and good airflow."

  - q: "What soil mix should I use?"
    a: "A free-draining mix such as 70% universal potting soil + 30% perlite. See ‘soil-mix-basics’ for variations."

  - q: "How do I avoid blossom drop?"
    a: "Maintain steady temps (avoid big night drops), do not overwater, and keep feeding moderate—slight dry-back helps set."

  - q: "Can I grow it in a window box or hanging basket?"
    a: "Yes. The trailing, compact habit suits window boxes and baskets; ensure strong light and adequate drainage."

  - q: "Do I need to prune?"
    a: "Optional light pinching during vegetative can improve bushiness. Avoid heavy pruning just before or during flowering."

  - q: "What about pests like aphids or fungus gnats?"
    a: "Use sticky traps for monitoring; let the top layer dry more; consider a thin sand/perlite cap; keep airflow gentle and consistent."

  - q: "Will cool rooms still produce fruit?"
    a: "Yes, but expect slower set and ripening below ~22°C. Target 22–28°C days for better performance."
