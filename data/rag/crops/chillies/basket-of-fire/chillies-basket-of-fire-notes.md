# Basket of Fire — Cultivation Notes (Indoor Mini-Greenhouse)

**Habit & size.** *Capsicum annuum* cultivar with a naturally **compact, cascading** habit suitable for window boxes
and small containers. Typical indoor height **20–30 cm**, with a spread up to **30–45 cm** under strong light.
Produces **numerous small fruits** continuously if harvested regularly.

**Temperature.** Performs at common room temps (**21–22°C**) with the usual trade-off: **cooler conditions slow
germination, flowering, and ripening**. Best day range **22–28°C**; nights **18–22°C**. Large night drops (>6–8°C)
increase the risk of blossom drop.

**Light.** Seedlings **14–16 h/day**, vegetative **12–14 h**, flowering **~12 h**. Keep LEDs close to limit
internode stretch; avoid leaf scorching. If you track PPFD, **250–400 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹** supports compact growth in
containers; lower intensity can work with longer photoperiods.

**Humidity & airflow.** Target **45–60% RH**. Gentle, consistent airflow strengthens stems and reduces damping-off.
Sustained >70–75% RH indoors can favor disease—ventilate and avoid late-day leaf wetting.

**Watering.** Water when the **top 1–2 cm** of media are dry. In cool/low-light rooms, reduce frequency. Overwatering,
especially during cool spells, is a primary cause of slow growth and blossom drop.

**Nutrition.** In soil/coco mixes, begin **mild feeding** after true leaves. Indicative EC bands:
**seedling 1.0–1.2**, **vegetative 1.2–1.6**, **flowering slightly leaner** for better fruit set. Aim **pH 6.0–6.8**.

**Containers & training.** Use **free-draining** mixes (see *Soil Mix Basics*). Step-up pot size gradually. Optional
**light pinching** during vegetative promotes bushiness; avoid heavy pruning near flowering. Cascading habit fits
**hanging baskets** and **window boxes** with good drainage.

**Pollination.** Self-fertile; gentle vibration/airflow helps in still rooms.

**Timeline examples.**
- **Cool room (~21–22°C, no heat mat):** sprout **10–14 d**, first true leaves **+7–10 d**, first flowers **60–90 d**.
- **Warm media (24–30°C) + strong light:** sprout **7–10 d**, first flowers **55–75 d**, earlier ripening with steady warmth.

**Common issues & quick fixes.**
- **Leggy seedlings:** increase photoperiod to 16 h; reduce lamp distance; add airflow.
- **Blossom drop:** avoid sudden cold; modest dry-back; keep nitrogen moderate.
- **Edema:** allow better dry-back; improve airflow; check pot-size vs. room temperature.
- **Aphids/gnats:** sticky traps; dry top layer; consider sand/perlite cap; maintain hygiene.

**Harvest.** Fruits ripen through cream/yellow/orange/red. **Frequent harvest** keeps production continuous.
Handle ripe pods carefully; wash hands/tools.

**Safety bounds (policy reminders).** Keep advice within **10–38°C** and **6–20 h light**; present deviations as **warnings**
with brief rationale.

**Notes for RAG.** These notes complement the structured YAML: use YAML for direct configuration/defaults and these notes
for explanations and practical heuristics.
