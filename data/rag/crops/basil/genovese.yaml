  displayName: Genovese Basil
  defaultStage: vegetative
overview: |
  Genovese basil is a compact, high-oil cultivar that prefers consistent warmth
  and evenly moist substrate. It responds quickly to pruning and will bolt when
  heat or drought stress persists for more than a few days.
stages:
  - id: seedling
    label: Seedling ramp
    cues:
      - Cotyledons fully opened and first true leaves emerging.
      - Substrate still loose enough that roots can expand without compaction.
    guidance: |
      Keep trays under bright but indirect light to avoid leggy stems. Aim for
      gentle airflow and avoid bottom heat above 26°C. Transplant once roots
      start circling the plug to prevent stress later.
  - id: vegetative
    label: Vegetative push
    cues:
      - Plants at least 10 cm tall with 4–6 sets of leaves.
      - Canopy dense enough that pruning yields a handful of leaves per plant.
    guidance: |
      Provide 14–16 hours of light with night temps no lower than 18°C. Pinch
      the apical tip every 7–10 days to keep new growth flush. Maintain even
      moisture but allow the top centimeter of substrate to dry before watering.
  - id: harvest
    label: Harvest & hold
    cues:
      - Lateral branches thick, producing clusters of leaves on each node.
      - Prefers slightly cooler nights (18–20°C) to slow bolting.
    guidance: |
      Rotate harvests so each plant keeps at least two full nodes. A deep prune
      every third harvest keeps the canopy young. Remove any flower spikes as
      soon as they appear to preserve flavor.
defaults:
  environment:
    temperature_day: "24°C"
    temperature_night: "19°C"
    humidity: "55-65%"
    light_hours: "16h photoperiod"
  irrigation:
    method: "Low-flow drip ring"
    frequency: "Once daily during vegetative surge, twice in peak heat"
    nutrient_ec: "1.6 mS/cm"
  pruning:
    cadence: "Pinch weekly; deeper cut every 3rd harvest"
    target_structure: "Two to three main stems with young laterals"
warnings:
  - stage: seedling
    text: "Dry trays stunt roots permanently. Mist lightly if EC climbs above 1.2."
  - stage: vegetative
    text: "Temps above 32°C for two days trigger bolting; drop lights or add airflow."
  - stage: harvest
    text: "Skipping pruning lets stems lignify, slowing new flushes within a week."
faq:
  - q: How do I spot nutrient stress early?
    a: |
      Watch for pale new leaves and burnt tips right after irrigation. Both
      indicate EC creep. Flush with plain water and resume at 80% strength.
  - q: Can I root cuttings to restart a batch?
    a: |
      Yes. Take 8–10 cm cuttings from healthy lateral branches, strip lower leaves,
      and keep in 0.3 EC water until roots reach 2 cm, usually 7–9 days.
