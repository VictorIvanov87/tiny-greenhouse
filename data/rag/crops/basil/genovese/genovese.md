# Genovese Basil Notes

Genovese basil responds to predictable cycles. Keep irrigation and nutrition
boring: same time every day, same EC unless leaves fade. When in doubt, flush
with tepid water and resume feed a day later. Track light intensity weekly—if
internodes stretch beyond 3 cm, lower the lights or add side-lighting strips.

When transitioning from vegetative push to harvest mode, drop day temps by 1–2°C
and extend the dark period by one hour. This keeps oils high without stalling
growth. Treat any flower spike as a signal to cool the canopy or prune harder.
